## Is your library stranded? options are [true, false]
stranded: true
# Possible values are [ff-firststrand, ff-secondstrand, ff-unstranded, fr-firststrand, fr-secondstrand, fr-unstranded (default), transfrags]
library_type: 'fr-firststrand'

##PARAMS
## Sample-Sample Heatmap params
RPKM_threshold: 1.0
min_num_samples_expressing_at_threshold: 1

## Filters out "SNO" and "MIR" RNA, options are [true,false]
filter_mirna: true

## Number of genes to be represented in the Sample-Sample, Sample-Feature, and PCA plots
numgenes_plots: 1000

## Plotting param for Sample-Feature Heatmap. Number represents number of kmeans in heatmap, 0 will output a hierarchical clustering heatmap, finally, a list of numbers (0,2,4) will output all three heatmaps in the same pdf
num_kmeans_clust: 4

#Turn on the following if you want a genome wide snp scan in addition to chr6 scan
# possible value are [true,false]
snp_scan_genome: false

#Uncomment the following if you want to perform a scan of viral dna on your samples
# possible value are [true,false]
virus_dna_scan: false

# If this flag is on, you must have a metasheet column called batch with at least 2 samples per batch
## Options are [false, true]
batch_effect_removal: false

## adjpval for a gene to be considered differentially expressed and be included in GOterm analysis
goterm_adjpval_cutoff: 0.1
## Number of GOterms in plot
numgoterms: 5
## Number of KEGG pathways in plot (note there is no cutoff herre because the KEGG module takes in full population statistics)
numkeggpathways: 5
